# **hclust-uniform-opendss**

This repository contains the source code for generating the dataset used in the [hclust-uniform](https://github.com/msk-5s/hclust-uniform) repository. This code will generate a synthetic voltage magnitude dataset using the [Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI)](https://www.epri.com/) ckt5 test feeder circuit. This dataset is composed of 672 voltage magnitude measurements from 1379 loads. Uniform white noise is used for the load profiles. Each column name in the dataset will contain the name of the load in the ckt5 circuit. Metadata will also be generated for each load containing the following:
- Name of the load in the ckt5 circuit.
- Phase that the load is connected to.

The generated dataset will be in the [Apache Arrow Feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html) format.

## Requirements
    - Windows
    - Python 3.8+ (64-bit)
    - OpenDSS 9.2.0.1+ (64-bit)
    - See requirements.txt file for the required python packages.

## Running
Since the ckt5 test feeder circuit `.dss` files aren't included in this repository, they will need to be copied from your OpenDSS installation folder to the `ckt5-src/` folder. The dataset can then be generated by simply running `run.py`.

## Converting to `.csv` (if desired)
Pandas can be used to convert a `.feather` file to a `.csv` file using the below code:
```
import pyarrow.feather

# A pandas dataframe is returned.
# We are assuming that we are in the repository's root directory.
data_df = pyarrow.feather.read_feather("data/load_voltage.feather")

data_df.to_csv("data/load_voltage.csv")
```
